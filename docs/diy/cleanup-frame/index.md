# Remove any excess metal parts

You are now at the point where you should remove any excess metal parts, burrs and rust. 

Start out with an angle grinder with a cutoff wheel and remove any larger metal parts. Clean up rust, burrs and excess wilds with an angle grinder with a grinding disk. If you do not wish to use an angle grinder, you can use hand tools but it will take much longer.
